# FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL

I will be making an interactive website for the DnD camapign, License to Adventure, that I am in. I am inspired by the usefulness of online tools like DnD Beyond, digital dice sets, and WorldAnvil. I am also inspired by 

### STEPS

- Standardize formatting by using an external stylesheet, including borders, size ratios, and naming conventions
	- need to learn details of what is necessary to include, and in what order
- Digital set of dice
	- need to learn how to make the visual of a dice
	- how to make it randomize and land on a "face"
	- how to format it so that it aligns with all the other formatting of the page
- Conspiracy Board
	- how to setup separate sections with different appearances
	- how to utilize animejs animation to allow dragging images from the art bank onto the board
	- how to add editable (and similarly draggable) text boxes
- Links
	- collect all relevant campaign links (need to ask for people's character sheets if they are digital)
- Character Sheets
	- syntehsize PC information to create pages for their 
- Gallery/Atlas
	- syntehsize and properly format all images


### ACTION PLAN

I have been jumping between several of these steps as I start working on something, figure a couple things out/get frustrated at roadblocks, and then move on to a different challenge so as to not stagnate too long. I regularly look up information/ask for help with things I truly don't understand, and apply what I learn. 

The first three steps of the proposal are my priority items for this project. They are the most important for my learning goals, and provide the best experience for anyone interacting with the website. While this is really intentioned for an audience of about six people, as its relevance is tied to the active DnD campaign, it will be accessible to anyone with the link/access to my github account. 

I will be documenting my process through git commit messages, audio files of explanations, and likely some additional written documentation.
